# MultiMedia

A new Flutter project.

![flutter_image](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.snmk3r72JlDpfRdiwmeZ3wHaCt%26pid%3DApi&f=1)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Cloning this github repository might not work for you, since most of the android build tools are not uploaded here. So you shall only download the following directories and files for this github repo.
    - assets/
    - fonts/
    - lib/
    - pubspec.yaml

If you know the basics of flutter, the above files would be more than enough to make an application like this.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
